# Introduction
======
{% endcomment %}

Hi, I’m **Yao Zhao** — a researcher working on **distributed systems, Edge AI, and cybersecurity**, with a focus on building **secure and trustworthy intelligent systems** for real-world applications.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **networked systems, artificial intelligence, and security**, particularly in resource-constrained and distributed environments such as **IoT and smart infrastructure**. I enjoy thinking about how intelligent systems can be made not only efficient, but also **reliable, interpretable, and trustworthy**.

I have experience working on topics including:
- Distributed and edge artificial intelligence  
- AI security and model integrity  
- Split learning and federated learning  
- Trustworthy data systems for IoT  

Beyond research, I enjoy teaching, mentoring students, and contributing to the academic community through **peer review and collaboration**. I value open research, reproducibility, and learning from others — most things worth building are built together ✨

If you are interested in my work or would like to collaborate, feel free to explore my publications and projects, or get in touch.
